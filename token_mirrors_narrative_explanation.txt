0x72Ad95C3B65A0da6826b336C104a929D1e676bF3 creates contract 0x16ca471ae755f8a2cd4ec315a4a7439dcfebe54c at 2024-05-29 21:05:47 and then creates the NexF token 29 minutes later. This contract appears to have been largely copied from an existing contract but includes numerous methods, including the ability to 'rug pull' by unilaterally removing liquidity and stopping trading.

The agent created a NexF to Wrapped Ether (WETH) contact on Uniswap (0x19e7Fe8CC2E813589Ce70CF48207e0D50a911d7a), which participants used extensively.

The agent appears to have posted the contract to a Telegram channel where 647 addresses interacted with it. Many of the interactions were initated using Telegram bots (such as Banana Gun and Maestro) and occured very rapidly (within seconds). Many addresses contain associated ENS records and can be easily identified (see early_addresses.csv, which includes a link to the Twitter page of a notable crypto trader).
